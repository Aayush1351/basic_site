It serves as a request and response procedure that all agents on the Internet follow so that information can be rapidly, easily and accurately disseminated between servers, which hold information, and clients, who are trying to access it. It does not use any kind of security mechanism to secure or encrypt its data, as a result third parties can gather data passed between the two systems and read them easily as the data is available in plain text, so these confidential data needs to be secured in order to prevent unauthorized access. For this reason HTTPS was developed by Netscape to allow authorization and secured transactions. HTTPS uses SSL which stands for Secure Socket Layer, a protocol for web browsers and servers that allows for the authentication, encryption and decryption of data sent over the internet. The S in HTTPS stands for Secure, it can also be called as HTTP with encryption. HTTP is fine for normal static website but while coming to filling the forms which requires sensitive or confidential information, its not a good practice. Comparing to each other HTTP is faster in terms of because of itss simplicity, in HTTPS, we have an extra step of SSL handshake unlike in HTTP which slightly delays the page load speed of the website."
